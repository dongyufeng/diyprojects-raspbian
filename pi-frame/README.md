    A digital picture frame aimed at family members,     
             such as grandparents.

The idea is that parents taking pictures of their children, can easily share those pictures with the children's grandparents by making them appear on the picture frame automatically. In turn, the grandparents can "like" the pictures, letting the children's parents know which pictures are their favourites.
